2,Raysor Formation,,557c3ad1e138239225f86760,"The most frequently applied names for Pliocene units in the Atlantic Coastal Plain are the Yorktown Formation (Clark and Miller, 1906; LeGrand and Brown, 1955; Akers, 1972; Hazel, 1971, 1977, 1983) from Virginia to North Carolina and the Duplin Formation (Cooke, 1936, 1945; Akers, 1972; Hazel, 1977) from North Carolina to Florida. Blackwelder and Ward (1979) equated the Duplin only with the middle part of the Yorktown (type area), proposed substituting the names Yorktown and Raysor for Duplin in South Carolina, and suggested that the name Duplin be abandoned. Cronin and others (1984) correlated the type Duplin (Natural Well, N.C.) with the upper part of the Yorktown Formation, and they consider both units to be late Pliocene in age. Both the Raysor Formation and the Givhans beds, which are local lithic names used in this paper, are correlated faunally to parts of the Yorktown Formation."

CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRATIGRAPHY term Raysor Formation should be restricted to lower Pliocene biocalcarenites with a quartzose matrix, whereas the term Goose Creek Limestone should be restricted to lower to middle Pliocene biocalcarenites with a calcareous matrix.
The physical stratigraphic relations between the Raysor Formation and the Goose Creek Limestone are presently unclear. The relative sparsity of quartz, kaolinite, hematite, and aragonite in the Goose Creek Limestone at Givhan's Ferry, as compared to the Raysor Formation at Raysor Bridge, Canadys Bridge, and Cross quarry, is striking. This difference is much greater than any seen within the known outcrop range of either unit (fig. 34). It is plausible that these two units represent onshore and offshore facies, respectively, of a single depositional cycle that graded very rapidly from a nearshore clastic phase to a shelf carbonate phase. For example, rapid gradation from a nearshore terrigenous phase to a shelf carbonate phase over a distance of less than 20 km has been documented for the Holocene sediments off the coast of Belize (Purdy and others, 1975)."
4,Raysor Formation,,55b736e4e13823bd29ba802f,"Ward indicates that such shells were the source of the matrix that Ward and Blackwelder described, but this material is atypical of the matrix collected in bulk quantity. Generally, the yellowish-gray-green shell bed at the Berkeley quarry locality also has abundant kaolinite, hematite, and aragonite and has a shell-rich matrix that contains 60 percent medium-grained quartz sand. Thus, on the basis of bulk matrix, the Berkeley quarry, Canadys Bridge, and original Raysor Bridge localities appear to be lithologically equivalent, but the proposed neostratotype for the Raysor Formation at Givhan's Ferry has a quite different lithology that is readily referred to the Goose Creek Limestone as Sloan originally suggested. Therefore, since the neostratotype proposed by Blackwelder and Ward (1979) would both totally alter the concept of the Raysor as originally established by Cooke (1936) and directly conflict with the concept of the ""Goose Creek phase"" (herein proposed as the Goose Creek Limestone) as established originally by Sloan (1908), the neostratotype of the Raysor Formation should be abandoned.

5,Raysor Formation,,58cb666bcf58f10af549ae27,"Such an age range for the phosphate-beds ""fauna"" is consistent with the age range of possible source beds in the Charleston area. These include the late Eocene portion of the Cooper Group; the early Chattian Ashley Formation (correlated with P20-21, NP 24 and possibly NP 23; Weems and Lemon, 1984; Weems, pers. comm.); the middle Chattian Chandler Bridge Formation; the late Chattian and/or Aquitanian Edisto Formation; the Burdigalian Marks Head Formation; a middle-late Miocene unit (the ""Rudd Branch beds"" of Weems et al., 1987) equivalent to the Choptank, the St. Marys, or the lower Eastover Formation of Ward and Blackwelder (1980); and the early Pliocene (Yorktown-equivalent) Raysor Formation and Goose Creek Limestone, plus various Pleistocene deposits (Weems, pers. comm.). Therefore it is possible that the sirenian fossils from the mining operations along the Ashley, Cooper, and Wando Rivers might include forms of almost any age from late Eocene to Pleistocene."
6,Raysor Formation,,557c3ad1e138239225f86760,"The Givhans beds, an informal unit in this paper named from the Pliocene beds exposed just north of Givhans Ferry on the east bank of the Edisto River, Dorchester County, S.C., are composed of fine- to medium-grained quartzose calcarenite. Aragonite is absent in these beds, but molds and casts of aragonitic mollusk shells are present. The basal contact is below a 1to 2-cm-thick bed of black, rounded phosphate pebbles. The unit is up to 7 m thick and is known from only a few outcrops and subsurface localities in the Charleston area. Although the unit is lithically distinct from the Raysor Formation, Blackwelder and Ward (1979) and Cronin (this volume) cannot separate this unit temporally from the Raysor Formation."
7,Raysor Formation,,557c3ad1e138239225f86760,"In spite of usually poor preservation, low diversity, and low abundance, calcareous nannofossils can be used to date Pliocene and Pleistocene South Carolina Coastal Plain marine sediments. When nannofossil data are used in conjunction with magnetic polarity, uranium dating, and planktonic foraminiferal information, fairly precise results are obtained for most units.
The following ages were determined for the marine units examined in South Carolina. The Raysor Formation and associated beds are early Pliocene in age in Zones NN 12-NN 15, 5.2 to 3.9 Ma. The Goose Creek Limestone and associated beds may span the early-late Pliocene boundary in Zones NN 15-NN 16, 3.9 to 3.2 Ma. The Bear Bluff Formation is a late Pliocene unit occurring somewhere within Zones NN 16-NN 18, 3.0 to 1.75 Ma. The Waccamaw(?) Formation occurs in early Pleistocene Zones NN 19a and (or) NN 19b, 1.7 to 1.2 Ma. The Penholoway Formation is in Pleistocene Zone NN 19d,"

The Yorktown Formation (Blackwelder and Ward, 1979) is the name used to describe fossiliferous, sandy and silty limestone and calcareous silty sand of Pliocene age that occur in South Carolina as erosional outliers. The Yorktown is biostratigraphically correlative with shelly calcareous outliers of the Raysor Formation (Blackwelder and Ward, 1979), which can be distinguished from the Yorktown by its greater clastic component. The Goose Creek Limestone (Weems and others, 1982) of early to middle Pliocene age is a fine- to coarse-grained, quartzose, phosphatic, sparsely shelly calcarenite and occurs in outcrop and in the shallow subsurface of Charleston and Berkeley Counties, S.C. It is identified by its calcareous matrix as compared with the quartzose matrix of the Raysor Formation."

9,Raysor Formation,,55b3dcdfe138231cbdd6d437,"The Raysor Formation of southwestern South Carolina is a bluish-gray, shelly, calcareous sand unit of Pliocene age that extends into northeastern Georgia. Beds now called Raysor were formerly included in the Duplin Formation of northeastern South Carolina,
Over most of the study area, Pleistocene rocks consist of medium- to coarse-grained, tan, white, and brown sand that locally contains trace amounts of carbonaceous material and broken shell fragments. These sands underlie a series of poorly defined to well-defined terraces that are thought to have formed during the Pleistocene Epoch as seas rose and fell in response to glacial and interglacial episodes (MacNeil, 1950). There is little agreement on the number of these terraces, however, and it is possible that some of the higher ones represent pre-Pleistocene deposits (Healy, 1975). In this report, all the terrace materials are considered to be Pleistocene."
11,Raysor Formation,,55b736e4e13823bd29ba802f,"Blackwelder and Ward (1979) suggested that the stratotype of the Raysor Formation be moved to Givhan's Ferry, a locality that neither Cooke, originally, nor Sloan believed to be equivalent to the ""marl"" at Raysor Bridge. The dissimilarity of the lithologies at these two sites is confirmed by our own studies, which show that the matrix of the pale-buff-gray Givhan's Ferry calcarenite contains about 25 percent quartz sand and only minor kaolinite and aragonite. This analysis matches well with the Goose Creek Limestone (to which Sloan, 1908, referred this locality) and is in marked contrast to the Raysor Bridge locality that yielded dark-blue (fresh) to gray-green (dry) sediment containing 63 percent quartz sand with about twice as much kaolinite, more aragonite, and more hematite than the Goose Creek. The material from the Raysor Bridge locality, however, does match the material correlated with it at the Martin Marietta Company Berkeley quarry (Ward and others, 1979, p. 6), although the matrix of this latter material is not so calcareous as they had indicated it to be. Articulated shells are filled with very fine grained calcarenite, perhaps because their cavities were not widely open to the bottom currents. Discussion with L. W. Ward indicates that such shells were the source of the matrix that Ward and Blackwelder described, but this material is atypical of the matrix collected in bulk quantity."
13,Raysor Formation,,55b736e4e13823bd29ba802f,"If future drilling furnishes new sections between the known Raysor and Goose Creek outcrop belts, the physical stratigraphic relations may become clear. In the meantime, all we can demonstrate is that the units are lithologically different where they are known. Should future work show the boundary to be gradational, 40 percent quartz in the sand-size matrix is tentatively suggested as the arbitrary lithologic boundary unless future field mapping shows some other parameter that better characterizes the change from the typical quartzose calcarenite (10-15 percent quartz-sand content) of the Goose Creek Limestone to the shelly quartz sand (60-65 percent quartz-sand content) of the Raysor Formation."
